vim-fix-git-diff-path v 37.4.0
  Adrian Likins <adrian@likins.com>

git diff includes a "a/path/to/file" in git diff
output. This is a pain, if you want to cut and
paste that path. This tries to let you just
c&p that entire prefixed path and do the
right thing. Ie, open the file referenced.
It should work anywhere in the git project
of the current working dir. It's mostly
intended for use from the command line but
in theory, any file loading command should work
we well.

bugs: - doesn't work if you are out of the git project
        directory.
      - probably confused if you have an actual file
        name something like a/path/to/file


this is based heavily on file_line.vim form
